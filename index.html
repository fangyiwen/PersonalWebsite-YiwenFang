        <h2>Brief Description</h2>
        <p>This website is created by Dr. Fang for the Project 1: Personal web page of CS5610: Web Development.</p>
        <p>The personal website is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and jQuery. And the website is built from
          scratch,
          without the aid of any starter tools or boilerplate code. The website is composed of three pages, i.e, Home,
          CV
          / Resume, and Selected Publications. GitHub is the external link.</p>

        <h2>Bullet Points Addressed</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The landing / top page is <code>index.html</code>. It has enough information, and links and navigation.
          </li>
          <li>The navigational element is the side menu. It will not scroll out of sight or disappear when the window is
            resized. The style is in a separate <code>.css</code> file.
          </li>
          <li>
            There are three internal links with three separate pages, including the Home page. The styling of the
            internal
            links matches the styling of the rest of the site. You can see the carefully designed colors, i.e., Oxford
            Blue <code>#002147</code>, light blue <code>#3479b2</code>, grey <code>#c7c2bc</code>, black, and white. The
            navigational elements are present
            in all the web pages. The menu element has a significantly different color (Oxford Blue), indicating the
            current page you are browsing. Internal links open their content in the same browser tab.
          </li>
          <li>The external link is GitHub which opens a new browser tab.</li>
          <li>Two HTML tables, with CSS styling are shown in CV / Resume and Selected Publications.</li>
          <li>
            There are three interactive / animated components written by jQuery. 1) The animated menu turns light blue
            when the mouse is over; 2) The CV table row turns light blue and the text turns white when the mouse is
            over;
            3) The Publication table column turns light blue and the text turns white when the mouse is over.
          </li>
          <li>
            This website follows responsive web design (RWD). It can be successfully viewed on different sized displays
            including desktops and mobile devices.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Additional Features</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Responsive design of images in the table.
            (<a href="html/selected_publications.html" id="link_click">Click</a>)
          </li>
          <li>The Selected Publications Page uses <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;i&gt;</code>,
            <code>&lt;u&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> to represent important, italic, underlined text, and
            computer code, respectively.
          </li>
          <li>The footer has both left-aligned and right-aligned texts in the same line.</li>
          <li>A sticky footer still hangs to the bottom of the browser if the page content is short.</li>
        </ul>
