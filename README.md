## Brief description

The personal website is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and jQuery. And the website is built from scratch, without the aid of any starter tools or boilerplate code. The website is composed of three pages, i.e, Home, CV / Resume, and Selected Publications. GitHub is the external link.

## Bullet points addressed

* The landing / top page is `index.html`. It has enough information, and links and navigation.
* The navigational element is the side menu. It will not scroll out of sight or disappear when the window is resized. The style is in a separate `.css` file.
* There are three internal links with three separate pages, including the Home page. The styling of the internal links matches the styling of the rest of the site. You can see the carefully designed colors, i.e., Oxford Blue `#002147`, light blue `#3479b2`, grey `#c7c2bc`, black, and white. The navigational elements are present in all the web pages. The menu element has a significantly different color (Oxford Blue), indicating the current page you are browsing. Internal links open their content in the same browser tab.
* The external link is GitHub which opens a new browser tab.
* Two HTML tables, with CSS styling are shown in CV / Resume and Selected Publications.
* There are three interactive / animated components written by jQuery. 1) The animated menu turns light blue when the mouse is over; 2) The CV table row turns light blue and the text turns white when the mouse is over; 3) The Publication table column turns light blue and the text turns white when the mouse is over.
* This website follows responsive web design (RWD). It can be successfully viewed on different sized displays including desktops and mobile devices.

## Additional features
* Responsive design of images in the table.
* The Selected Publications Page uses `<strong>`, `<i>`, `<u>`, and `<code>` to represent important, italic, underlined text, and computer code, respectively.
* The footer has both left-aligned and right-aligned texts in the same line.
